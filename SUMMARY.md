**Multi-resolution dataset for photovoltaic panel segmentation from satellite and aerial imagery** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the urban planning, energy, environmental, and urban planning industries. 

The dataset consists of 3716 images with 3713 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*photovoltaic_panel*).

Images in the PV dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 3 (0% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset contatins dataset (***PV01***, ***PV08***, ***PV03***) and ***category*** tags. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory, Nanjing Normal University, and China Provincial Geomatics Center of Jiangsu.
